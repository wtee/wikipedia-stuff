&lt;blockquote&gt;Carver worked on improving soils, growing crops with low inputs, and using species that fixed nitrogen (hence, the work on the cowpea and the peanut). Carver wrote in 'The Need of Scientific Agriculture in the South': &quot;The virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture. This exhaustive system for cultivation, the destruction of forest, the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter, have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the North, East or West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, Toby.

Wilson was elected to the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] in 1867, and served as speaker from 1870 to 1871 before becoming a professor of agriculture at what is now [[Iowa State University]], where he encouraged the work of [[George Washington Carver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Special Collections Department|title=James A. &quot;Tama&quot; Wilson Papers,  RS 9/1/11|url=http://www.add.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/arch/rgrp/9-1-11.html|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also appointed to the Board of Trustees (now Regents) of Iowa's public higher educational institutions, serving from 1870 to 1874.

Iowa State is the home of the first elevated steel water tank west of the [[Mississippi River]].

As an undergraduate, Spedding took issue with the prevailing explanation by [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] of how the six [[carbon]] [[atom]]s in [[benzene]] hold together and proposed an alternate explanation. His professor, [[Moses Gomberg]], recognised this as being the same as the (incorrect) model advanced by [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1869. At Gomberg's suggestion, Spedding applied to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], to study for his doctorate under [[Gilbert N. Lewis]]. Gomberg wrote a recommendation so that Spedding was not only accepted, but given a teaching fellowship as well.{{sfn|Corbett|2001|p=4}} Under Lewis's supervision, Spedding earned his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1929,&lt;ref name=&quot;papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.add.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/arch/rgrp/17-01-11.pdf|title=Frank Spedding papers|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing his thesis on &quot;Line absorption spectra in solids at low temperatures in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum&quot;.{{sfn|Corbett|2001|p=3}} It was published that year in the ''[[Physical Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Line Absorption Spectra of Solids at Low Temperatures in the Visible and Ultra-Violet Regions of the Spectrum a Preliminary Study of GdCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;•6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from Room Temperature to that of Liquid Hydrogen

Iowa State first put together a volleyball squad in 1973 under coach Gloria Crosby.  Initially just playing in regional tournaments and the occasional one off match, they began participating in the brand new [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] tournament in 1976.  Then in 1982 the Big Eight offered volleyball as a full sport including in-season conference play.  The Cyclones struggled to put together competitive squads for most of their early years. Until 1995 they were unable to finish in the top half of the Big Eight.
